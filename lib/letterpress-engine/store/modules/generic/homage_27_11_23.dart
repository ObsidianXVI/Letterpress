                    "What I realised was that most, if not all, of my coding projects were all very closely tied to the Dart language and Flutter framework. From contributions to the Flutter community such as through Project Redline, Orca, and Affogato Editor, to dependency on Flutter as a powerful framework for The Lighthouse Project and my personal site, the perfect fit of Flutter/Dart for all of my coding needs was an amazing coincidence."),

                content:
                    "However, this discovery would not have been possible if I had just given up on The Lighthouse Project, which was my first serious undertaking. Initially, I had planned to use EditorX to build the website, but since it lacked fine-grain control over design, I had to look for alternative platforms. Since I was only familiar with Python and NodeJS at the time, it was a very unnerving predicament to be in. But I did not give up. Many YouTube videos and documentation readings later, I had finally settled upon Flutter as the right tool to move forward with. While I was more familiar with the runner-ups â€” NativeScript and AngularJS â€” since I was fluent in NodeJS, Flutter seemed to be better for me in the long term."),

With mastery of a statically-typed language like Dart, I find myself confidently exploring various ideas and undertaking projects to experiment with different concepts. The extremely pivotal nature of that one decision, and of not giving up, is something that cannot be done justice by mere words on a line. "),
