## Problem Situation
## Design Brief

# Imagining "Affogato"
- feature list (inspired by Monaco editor)
- looking at xcode interface, interactions
- knowing how VScode looks like

# Designing
- trying to do proto in Figma, too time-consuming => create wireframe

- developing the widget
    - trying to use TextField based on existing research

    verses: [
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
    ]
